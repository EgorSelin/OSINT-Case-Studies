# Verification of Claimed Law Enforcement Affiliation

**Background:**  
A woman, Olga, contacted the contributor regarding a man, Sergey, living in the same dormitory. Sergey was physically abusive, frequently intoxicated, and claimed to be a major in a powerful Ukrainian security agency. Olga wanted to verify his claims before filing a police report.

**Objective:**  
Determine whether Sergey was genuinely affiliated with a law enforcement agency and gather verifiable information to support legal action.

**Methods and Sources:**  
- **Telegram OSINT bots & GetContact:** Phone number attribution  
- **Social media analysis:** Connections and behavioral indicators  
- **OpenDataBot & YouControl:** Business affiliations and past company ownership  
- **Public court and registry databases**  
- **HUMINT:** Discreet inquiries via trusted sources in relevant institutions

**Key Findings:**  
- Two companies linked to Sergey (one dissolved, one active in a rural area)  
- Previously registered as a sole proprietor (now inactive)  
- No official records or declarations confirming government service  
- HUMINT confirmed: not affiliated with the claimed agency  
- Multiple administrative offenses; listed as a victim in a fraud case

**Outcome:**  
Sergey had been falsely claiming status in a powerful agency to intimidate others. The verified information gave Olga confidence to file an official report with the National Police.

**Takeaway:**  
OSINT and HUMINT aren’t just about data — they can protect real people and support justice.
