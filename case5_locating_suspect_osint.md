# Locating a Suspect Using Open-Source Intelligence

**Background:**  
As a former law enforcement officer in Ukraine, the contributor was asked by a colleague to help locate a suspect. Internal databases only contained outdated information — an inactive phone number, a name, and an old address.

**Objective:**  
Gather and structure open-source intelligence (OSINT) to update contact and location details for actionable use by law enforcement.

**Methods and Sources:**  
- **Telegram bots:** Expanded phone numbers, identified linked accounts, and searched for active numbers.  
- **Address analysis:** Cross-referenced the provided address to identify former residents connected to the suspect.  
- **Public registries:** Used YouControl, OpenDataBot, court and administrative records, property and vehicle registries to uncover assets and past violations.  
- **Social media (Instagram, Facebook):** Verified connections between the suspect and relatives.

**Result:**  
A structured dossier was delivered to law enforcement containing updated phone numbers, addresses, and property/vehicle information. Using this alongside internal resources, the suspect’s current location was determined and they were successfully apprehended.

**Notes:**  
All information was obtained legally using only open-source data. Names, cities, and organizations are withheld for confidentiality.

**Jurisdiction:** Ukraine
